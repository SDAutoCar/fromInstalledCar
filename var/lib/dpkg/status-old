Description: replacement for GNU Pth using system threads
 nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
 similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
 replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
 contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
 implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
 compatible to GNU Pth.

  - Lack of maintenance.
  - Use of poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known
    side-channel attacks).
  - Lack of high level, "Cryptography for humans", APIs.
  - Absence of algorithms such as AES-GCM.
  - Poor introspectability, and thus poor testability.
  - Extremely error prone APIs, and bad defaults.

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.24' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.24') instead.

Description: FFmpeg library with functions for simplifying programming - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming.
 It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data
 structures, additional mathematics functions, cryptography and multimedia
 related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats).
 It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.
 The goal for this library is to be modular, small, efficient and useful.
 .
 This package contains the development files.

 AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between Latin and
 non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also installs console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: System call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library (devel)
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries and header files you need
 to develop your programs using the minimalistic Netlink communication
 library.

 TwoLAME does NOT support MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) encoding due to patent
 issues surrounding MP3.
 .
 However, as most MPEG Audio players are able to play layer 2 (MP2) files,
 TwoLAME makes a very good drop-in replacement for LAME and other layer 3
 encoders.

Description: utility for directing compilation
 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Depends: python3:any (>= 3.5~)
Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.
 .
 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 3.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: FFmpeg library with functions for simplifying programming - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming.
 It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data
 structures, additional mathematics functions, cryptography and multimedia
 related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats).
 It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.
 The goal for this library is to be modular, small, efficient and useful.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: asynchronous event notification library - runtime library
 Libuv is the asynchronous library behind Node.js. Very similar to libevent or
 libev, it provides the main elements for event driven systems: watching and
 waiting for availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like timers
 or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes with some other extras
 like:
  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which you can link
 your program.

Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.11)
Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 Every X11 vendor provides its own XKB data files, so keyboard layout
 designers have to send their layouts to several places.  The
 xkeyboard-config project has been launched at FreeDesktop in order
 to provide a central repository that could be used by all vendors.

Description: Autogenerate and use a swap file
 This init.d script exists so one does not need to have a fixed size
 swap partition. Instead install without swap partition and then run this,
 with file size (re-)computed automatically to fit the current RAM size.
 .
 By default (and hence on installation) it creates swapfile twice as
 big as the present RAM amount with an upper limit of 2 GB.
 .
 It's also very helpful when included in SD card, USB stick or disk
 images which are distributed and run on many machines with different
 amount of RAM, e.g. different models of the Raspberry Pi or cloud
 images.

Description: TCP/IP swiss army knife
 A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network

 programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network
 debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind
 of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in
 capabilities.
 .

 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,

 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: mode switching data for usb-modeswitch
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the commands data needed for usb-modeswitch.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the binaries and the brother scripts.

 This package provides the shared libraries for SELinux policy management.
 It uses libsepol for binary policy manipulation and libselinux for
 interacting with the SELinux system.  It also exec's helper programs
 for loading policy and for checking whether the file_contexts
 configuration is valid (load_policy and setfiles from
 policycoreutils) presently, although this may change at least for the
 bootstrapping case

 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a
 number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to
 add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.

Description: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
 maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
 library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
 compression.
 .
 For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on

 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: global hotkey daemon for Linux
 Triggerhappy watches connected input devices for certain key presses
 or other input events and runs administrator-configured
 commands when they occur. Unlike other hotkey daemons, it runs as a
 persistent, systemwide service and therefore can be used even
 outside the context of a user or X11 session.
 .
 It can handle a wide variety of devices (keyboards, joysticks,
 wiimote, etc.), as long as they are presented by the kernel as
 generic input devices. No kernel patch is required. The daemon is
 a userspace program that polls the /dev/input/event? interfaces
 for incoming key, button and switch events. A single daemon can
 monitor multiple input devices and can dynamically add additional
 ones. Hotkey handlers can be assigned to dedicated (tagged) devices
 or globally.
 .
 For example, this package might be useful on a headless system to
 use input events generated by a remote control to control an
 mpd server, but can also be used to allow the adjustment of audio
 and network status on a notebook without relying on user specific
 configuration.
 .
 Key combinations are supported as well as the hotplugging of devices
 using a udev hotplug script; the running daemon can also be influenced
 by a client program, e.g. to temporarily pause the processing of
 events or switch to a different set of hotkey bindings.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or

 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixelformat
 to BGR24, RGB24, YUV420 and YVU420.

Description: XZ-format compression library - development files
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 The native format of liblzma is XZ; it also supports raw (headerless)
 streams and the older LZMA format used by lzma. (For 7-Zip's related
 format, use the p7zip package instead.) This package provides the
 development library needed to build programs using liblzma.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - runtime files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: GNU privacy guard - cryptographic agent
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.
 .
 This package contains the agent program gpg-agent which handles all
 secret key material for OpenPGP and S/MIME use.  The agent also
 provides a passphrase cache, which is used by pre-2.1 versions of
 GnuPG for OpenPGP operations.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 is possible to support complex environments requiring system
 configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
 instantiation.
 .
 CMake was developed by Kitware as part of the NLM Insight
 Segmentation and Registration Toolkit project. The ASCI VIEWS project
 also provided support in the context of their parallel computation
 environment. Other sponsors include the Insight, VTK, and VXL open

 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Suggests: python-h5py-doc
Description: general-purpose Python interface to hdf5 (Python 3)
 HDF5 for Python (h5py) is a general-purpose Python interface to the
 Hierarchical Data Format library, version 5. HDF5 is a versatile, mature
 scientific software library designed for the fast, flexible storage of
 enormous amounts of data.
 .
 From a Python programmer's perspective, HDF5 provides a robust way to
 store data, organized by name in a tree-like fashion. You can create
 datasets (arrays on disk) hundreds of gigabytes in size, and perform
 random-access I/O on desired sections. Datasets are organized in a
 filesystem-like hierarchy using containers called "groups", and accessed
 using the tradional POSIX /path/to/resource syntax.
 .
 H5py provides a simple, robust read/write interface to HDF5 data from
 Python. Existing Python and Numpy concepts are used for the interface;
 for example, datasets on disk are represented by a proxy class that
 supports slicing, and has dtype and shape attributes. HDF5 groups are
 presented using a dictionary metaphor, indexed by name.
 .
 This package provides h5py for the Python 3 interpreter.
